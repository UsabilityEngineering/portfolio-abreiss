# Shower Mismatch

In my apartment the shower has one handle that adjusts the water level and temperature. If you move the handle at all it is on at full pressure. It has a color-coded indicator with red and blue labels. Based on my previous interactions with showers, I assumed this meant red for hot and blue for cold but. I moved the handle towards the blue side and after waiting 5 seconds the water heater responded and to my surprise the water became very hot

This is when I realized this shower used blue for hot and red for cold. This was likely an error in building it. Due to the water heater being slow, the user also does not get **feedback** for a few seconds when changing the temperature in the shower, which can add to frusteration. 

This experience relates to the **Match between system and the real world** heuristic, which states that systems should follow real-world conventions and make information appear in a natural and logical order. In most designs, red universally represents hot and blue represents cold. The user’s mental model which is based on years of consistent exposure to this pattern  is that turning the handle toward red should increase the water temperature.
